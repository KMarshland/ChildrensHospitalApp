This example shows how to hook up mousedown events from C#. You can do the same with keydown/up, too. Each element defines OnMouseDown/Up etc delegates that you can hook on to. Alternatively, use your C# class name to point e.g. onmousedown directly at a C# function, such as onmousedown="CSharpExample.Direct". Nitro may instead be used with onmousedown="nitroFunctionName".
