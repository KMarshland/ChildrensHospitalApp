*This will become a complete feature in PowerUI 2 - for now it's a proof of concept only*


- This shows the extra power that InfiniText can provide with glyph access.
- The process which converts glyphs into 3D polygons is incomplete and as a result you will see broken letters (e.g. i).
- These broken letters occur when there are two distinct shapes, like in an i. This is simply because the process doesn't account for them yet.
- The API used to actually display the letters is incomplete.
- Similarly the integration with Spark (PowerUI's CSS layout engine) is incomplete too.
- Mesh generation is not optimised. Each word will be it's own mesh.

As a result, please only use this if:
- You see the results you're after in the Editor.
- You accept the API will change with PowerUI 2, probably dramatically.
