		<u>Click and drag this element to get it to scroll</u><br><br>
		<br>
		<br>
		This is done by C# methods which can be reused anywhere in the project. When this element is clicked, it gets focused and the C# script, DragScroller, stores the location of the mouse. 
		Because it's focused, onmousemove also occurs. Mouse up might not occur on this element though, so the mousemove function looks out for a mouse up. 
		When one occurs, it simply unfocuses this element.
		<br>
		<br>
		Note the use of text-clip on the scrollers style. Optional of course, but this disables an optimisation which makes text appear to get squished otherwise.
		<br>
		<br>
		Time for some random text! Welcome to the PowerUI source documentation pages. These are available for anybody wishing to directly integrate or use internal features of PowerUI. If you're looking for guides on how to do things with PowerUI, head over to the <a href='http://powerui.kulestar.com/'>main PowerUI website</a>.

		<b>Notable features</b>
		<br>
		PowerUI has many features, but some will of course be much more useful than others. Here's some features to get you started:
		<br>
		<br>
		Http - HTTP requesting which works from just about everywhere. If you've used Unities built in WWW class, you'll find it only works from monobehaviours. Note that this is still subject to the same security restrictions.
