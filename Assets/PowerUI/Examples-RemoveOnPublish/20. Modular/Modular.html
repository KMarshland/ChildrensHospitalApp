	Sometimes it's really useful to break a UI down into sections called modules. For example, you might want to have all your inventory related html and code in it's own file.
	<br>
	<br>
	This is really easily done with iframes. By default, iframe paths point at your Resources folders - that's content in any folder called "Resources". Iframes have no particular overheads so you can use as many as you want.
	<br>
	<br>
	Any style that you want to share across modules, like the appearance of your buttons or the fonts used, is best placed in a file called customStyle.html. This file must be in any folder called "Resources".
