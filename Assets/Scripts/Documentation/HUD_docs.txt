Each "screen" should be defined in a separate function
These functions are automatically called based on the screenID, a unique identification string
When adding a new screen, make sure to link the new screenID to the function in Start()
To switch between screens, simply change the screen id

All positions should be defined as percentages with the FRect class
For example, new FRect(0.1f, 0.1f, 0.8f, 0.8f) would give a rectangle that was the middle 80% of the screen
